# Voltage Comparator Stoplight Project

This repository contains the project documentation for the Voltage Comparator Stoplight I developed over the summer. The project utilized an operational amplifier (op-amp), diodes, batteries, and a voltage generator to create a functional traffic stoplight simulation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design and construct a voltage comparator stoplight system, demonstrating a strong understanding of analog electronics and control systems.

Key Components:
- Operational amplifier (op-amp)
- Diodes
- Batteries
- Voltage generator

## Features

- Configured the op-amp as a voltage comparator to compare input voltage levels.
- Implemented a traffic stoplight simulation using LEDs to represent the red, yellow, and green lights.
- Achieved precise voltage control to simulate the stoplight's behavior accurately.
- Demonstrated efficient use of electronic components and a clear understanding of analog circuits.
